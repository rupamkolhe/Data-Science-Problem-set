review,rating
Seems to be a first copy . Cause it's cover page is roughly finished and cut,1
I want to bring buyers attention that Flipkart has fallen to such low levels as to sell pirated books. It not just takes the entire experience away also makes me feel sad that Flipkart is now trying to steel livelihood from writers and publishers. They work so hard and put years to publish a book of lifetime. Please buy an original book at some authentic place to make sure the writers are being compensated for their hard work. I will never buy books from Flipkart again.,1
The book wasn't has expected. It was like worn out condition.,1
Ordered steve jobs writer is issac walter and 2 consecutive times i got the book from different random author.Original book has 600 something pages while this book has only 250 pages..

The paper quality of book is extremely pathetic. This is as good as buying from street. You will get same paper quality in less Ruppes than spending 350.,1
The book is not orginal. The plastic in the front page is coming out. The pages are yellow. The page no.s that should be in italics are not in italics. The pictures before every chapter is not visible. The indentation is horrible. Some letters are invisible. You're gonna regret buying the book !,1

"This seller is a fraud, and this is not a paper back edition. MRP marked on book is Rs 550 for which I was charged Rs 597(post discount). Please do business ethically if possible I'll take this to consumer court cause selling product over MRP is illegal in India.I'll also urge Flipkart to take action against such sellers.",1
"Totally unsatisfied with the delivery item. The book that was delivered has several pages missing. A return delivery message was asked couple of days after the delivery. The only message we get is ""We're sorry. We are unable to process your replacement request"". Flipkart being an Indian service provider we have very high expectations from you all. Especially when we have better service providers we can switch too.",1
This book is for the people who are passionate or curious about steve jobs or anything related to him. Personally this book is costly and out of the way for the first timers who are switching to biographies or reading it for a change like myself. You can mosstly see all the events in jobs life in a 40 minute documentry instead of 650 Inr book.But again its all about passion if you interested in jobs or his products or inspired by him Buy it.,2
The price mentioned on the backside of the book is Rs 550. I was charged Rs 689 for buying this book.Book it self great though.,2
Besuse i give 2 star the book is damege,2
Paper quality,2
Product quality is Below average.,2
"The book is great to know about jobs, but the paper quality and print of this publisher is really bad, I would recommend you to go for a better publisher, those extra money u put is really going to pay off.",2
Book is worth.. but page quality is very bad ... buy with some other merchants,2
Font. Quality is not good. As it is paperback but it should have font in proper way.,2
"It's pirated book, poor printing,",2
Font are too small,2
What a ridiculous book quality! Pathetic. It isn't even worth a hundred but I paid 350 for it. I'm glad there's a return policy lurking in there. Sometimes I feel like getting my head into a bookstore and returning with an authentic book instead of trusting flipkart.,2
Paper quality is not good.,2
I got the book in bad condition it was dirty which included dirt marks and many wrinkles on the cover as if it was folded badly,2
Plz check the seller before you buy it.... Otherwise they fooled you by giving poor inhouse printing book,2
good,2
paper quality is not good.,2
book quality not good. more like a photocopy print out,2
The paper quality used is very bad. But a great book to read...,2
Received this book print and paper quality is poor better buy a original hardback,2
On in time,2
The content of the book is excellent but the publisher has done an equally terrible job of printing and binding. Cover had disgusting yellow marks on it and paper quality is of the worst possible order. Charge ‚Çπ100 extra and give better quality.,2
pls. don't buy this.print quality and binding is very bad.pages are coming off while you go through the book..,2
"The matter is good and very inspirational, though the book quality is very bad. When I   Took it out of the parcel, its quality was bad as second hand books .",2
Everything is gud but the quality of pages is cheap!,2
Poor paper quality,2
"Though it looks new, quality of the printing isn't so good. Little over priced in terms of quality",2
The book I received had a different front cover and the quality and print of the book is not good. The pictures in the book look like xerox copies of b&w photos. I am not buying any book from this seller again. The content within book is sure super awesome!,2
The quality of the book is not good. And there was no bookmark along with it !,2
Quality of the pages and the font is bad.,2
I bought a paperback edition of the book and the condition is pretty beat up. The book is crumbled from all sides. I don't want to return again because the whole process would take a week. But the seller is not good.,2
"I am a huge fan of ""steve jobs"".Firstly when i read the reviews I thought it was excellent but it didn't reach the expectations........",2
"This is a must read book for technology and business enthusiasts. Very simple language, Good photographs and smooth story telling are main attractions. But its build quality is very poor. Pages are falling out due to low quality binding.Flipkart service is good.",2
Page quality very bad...so I return that book,2
"Pages are torn, the cover of the book has no finishing. The plastic over the covering is coming out. The printing inside is not straight. Some of the letters are missing sometimes. The puctures at the beginning of every chapter is sometimes so bad that it's hard to understand what is there in the picture.Highly Unsatisfactory ! !",2
"The book seems to have been in storage for a very long time, as is evident from the various spots on the cover and the indentation marks of thread (or rope) used to tie bundles of books together. Also, the paper quality is very low (thinner than that of newspapers) suggesting that it may be an illegal reprint edition. Nevertheless, the content is amazing as it talks about the life of one of the greatest minds in the field of technology.",3
"VERY GOOD BOOK.LIFE OF A CONTEMPORARY VISIONARY WHO MADE BEST PRODUCTS FOR PEOPLE.HE TRIED TO ADD BEST MATERIALS IN MOBILES.FIXED BEST PRICE FOR THE PRODUCTS.MASS PRODUCED, MARKETED AND SOLD TO MASSES IN MASS.

"The quality of book cover was not good. I guess i was provided a book which was previously returned by someone. There were pen marks on the cover and it was dirty too. Along with that, after ordering 3 books, not even a single bookmark",3
Book is awesome in every aspect but the page quality is totally blunder,3
Great Page quality could be improved,3
"The print quality is very bad. In some pages, some letters towards the right sides are not printed and some pages have wrong alignment. None of the pictures are visible.",3
"An excellent book to read. But the quality of the book material was pathetic. For sure it's not the original publication. Seems to be a cheap remake of the original book as the print was quite off and unreadable at a few places. Even the cover page print was quite off. If that doesn't matter to you, definitely a must buy.",3
Content is awesome.. Btt page quality is poor...,3
Print was not that good and satisfactory...but it was okay...,3

The book is good but it come to me in 15 days.. it delayed and delayed.... Bad delivery,3
Good book and easy written but pages quality is too poor happy with flipkart timely dilevery,3
This was the first time I tried a store called shivani books. Should have known better. The book doesn't even have the right photograph of Steve Jobs üôÑ I don't even want to talk about the binding and page quality. I mean how can a seller be this corrupt. Wish they had negative stars to award.Edit- Later I ordered from NSPRetail. They always have been the cheapest and quickest in terms of delivery.,3
Cover is good. Print quality is just pathetic..,3
Quality of the book is not so good..,3

"pages were not good , but story is amazing",3
Page quality not as expected,3
Page quality was not very good,3
Okay but not original.,3
The book is of poor quality. But taking the price of the original edition into consideration it provides good value for money.,3
good book but its not had a hardcover and liitle damage but goood to read,3
I loved this book a lot,3
Some page's are not in good condition but overall a great book.,3
received in a very poor conditionhad to returnI find it's a common complaint about the productplease choose some other edition of this great book,3
Way too much  stretched.I understand that what 'Making dent' is but this is not a book or something I would recommend/suggest someone.,3
Awsum book but Paper quality was very bad !,3
The book was good but poor dilevry,3
Product quality very poor. Not an origanl book it's a 1st copy. But material is readable. Not bad. But not recommended also instead try the original book.,3
It's good and useful product,3
Nice well conditioned,3
The binding is very bad. The paper quality is also miserable. Although the book is great due to Walter Isaacson.,3
"Good page quality, very bad binding, other credits to Isaacson .",3
The Condition of the book is really poor but the content is great.,3
"3 Stars not for the content in the book, it deserves 5 but the quality and condition in which it was delivered to me.",3
A wonderful and a must read book for every entrepreneur and engineer or a visionary.The product that was sent was old and worn out.,3
Good book but papers are falling apart,3
"I m surprised even after so many people complaining about its pages Flipkart has not done a thing 2 improve it. Basically writing a review is worthless, a waste of time coz they won't do anything. Stars r only 4 Steve Jobs.",3
Paper quality is bad,3
"Book is splendid. Captures every aspect of Steve's life in a beautiful and honest way. I would have gone for 5 stars but given the quality of paper I had to reconsider.Quite bad quality paper used,almost looks as if a pirated version.",3
The book is a fantastic read. The Print on some pages are not clear or missing. Can be better.,3
"Book is a good read..paper quality is of reused papers, many missing words i.e. not printed properly or half printed! !",3
"The book is no doubt a masterpiece but in order to get the book quickly, flipkart has compromised with the packaging. When I receieved the book, all the corners of the hard cover were bent. I hope you do a better job going forward witht that.",3
"As this book is about Steve Jobs journey so, its gud 4 those who want to know more about apple way towards top companies in the word",3
"Its mentioned as hard cover, I felt its gonna be a hard cover with the cover photo embedded. But its just cover page wrapped around a hard plain white color cover. The photo on cover (which is just a paper) is completely detached and will sure loose it from the book cover.",3
"Received the delivery ahead of time. So thumbs up to Flipkart for that.Everyone knows about the book. Its the best SJ biography, so no comments on book content.The paper and print quality is not as expected. Its a LPE (Low price Edition) I guess.",3
A wonderful person and visionary who brought amazing new technologies to the world. Will be exiting to know how SIRI changes the way we communicate now. I believe SIRI is going to be big threat to google going ahead.,3
Delivery took time.,3
"Good book. No, great book. All about Steve Jobs that you wanted to know, from personal to professional. It will inspire you right away. But I bought it for Rs. 559 from flipkart and now its price is Rs. 602? Why?",4
"Absolutely worth every single penny! Life story of a doer, a dreamer, a visionary, a genius. Kudos to Isaacson for keeping it so neutral and so interesting! I had already seen the documentary Pirates of the Silicon Valley, so already knew some stuff about Job's life. But thank God to this Book. So much better than the tacky movie I just mentioned! MUST READ.",4
The look of the book is so classy yet simple just like the apple products. I wont be surprised if someone told me that Jobs had designed it himself. excellent insight into the great mans life and yea was very surprised to read abt his tantrums,4
"Got my book on 25th Thanks to Flipkart's awesome delivery logisitics.Well, the Cover itself is so absorbing, m sure Steve is happy and totally content with the cover as he had desired for.i'm half way through n to be honest, it is the first of my Non-Management books that i even carry to work. It is that invitingGo buy ur copies at the earliest...Flipkart will make sure u have them delivered at the soonest. You cant have anything better if u r a die-hard Steve Jobs' fanCheers",4
Amazing read. We'll written and detailed life about Steve Jobs. Great inspiration can be derived from the book and the way it is being narrated.,4
Its a good book of a best enterpenure of era. Mr. Jobs is inspiration of our society. I ordered and got In note ban time.,4
amazing insight into the birth and growth of the world's most well known brand. what captures the readers would be Steve's grit determination and never say die attitude. His leadership skills and ways and means of eliminating/manipulating his rivals is noteworthy and finally why apple makes only beautiful products. Great read!!! !,4
"A well written book and an interesting read.. Steve Jobs doesn‚Äôt inspire me to be him ‚Äì not with his arrogance, management style, etc., etc..But then He was a genius and I am not!! ;) Am not an Apple Product user and so not an Apple Fan.. so I was not biased towards him or Apple before I ‚Äújust like that‚Äù decided to read this book. But while reading the book, not once I felt he dominated the writing (as is his usual style).",4
I was never really an admirer of this man. This biography has been well crafted by W.  Issacson and to me its nothing more than a serious attempt of a creative genius.,4
the book is great well written. but its huge in size and the binding tears with time. i prefer buying hardcover if you are book collector or you want to preserve the book.,4
Very good book which gives insight of a man's life who is so different from conventional ones. The book is very easy to read and engaging,4
I got this gem for just 360 Rs. as you were running  a promotional offer. Will read the book and post a review here. Got it within a day of ordering and in excellent condition.I wanted to read the book since Steve died but always found the price was really high.So i was glad to get it for so cheap.,4
"Another book purchased by the pre order option. And is perhaps the most satisfying. Must congratulate Flipkart for packing the book in such a way that it retains the pristine, pure cover. Walter Isaacson has has belted out a winner of a biography under any kind of literary spectrum. The manner in which he dwells on the aspects of Jobs life that appear dear to him, would be his greatest accomplishment for the book.",4
This was the first book i purchased on Flipkart. Not only that this was my first book purchase online ever!,4
"This is a great piece of work by Walter Isaacson. The book is a great memoir about Steve Jobs which tells about his personal life his traits and other important facets of his personality. These facets include being a marketeer, great leader, great friend etc. It is a great read not only for an Apple fan but for everyone who is intrigued by Steve Jobs.",4
"Haven't yet got to complete the whole book, but as far as i have read, its good.Must read for all entrepreneurs.the language is easy to read.though i wish the book could have been a little thinner for easy travel and reading :)",4
"I bought the book with high expectation, as one of mycolleague highly recommended it. And it did live up to theexpectation, very well written, and for anyone who has seenand liked the ""stage performances"" of Steve, you'll know how he got there, and all about Apple.",4
"I see the book as a great work of the writer as it is of Steve Jobs. The book gives insight of this very successful person , his business and personal life. While the business like is inspiring and eventful and shows facets of Steves Personality, it gives the reader both what not to do and what to do to make the best come out of you. The writer has brought out the best one could have , merging view points, sequentially referencing the interviews, relevant persons and events.",4
"I'm not neither an avid autobiography reader nor a Steve Jobs fanatic but this one book reads like a dream. Its super well-written, interestingly crafted chapters and terribly honest stories make it a must-read for anyone interested in businesses, consumer technology, the world of brands or human psychology. Gives amazing insight into the man that he was and his vision for the brand.",4
"A detailed account about the visionary, giving vivid details of his genius n idiosyncrasies alike. Now I kno y ppl love n get addicted to all that is made by Apple :-) (me included). I m a apple fan ! !Simple and clear ........ no bias to good or bad ... just his life as it is ... he is really crazy .... but you see ingenuity and insanity are apart but a thin line :-) V.Good Read",4
"Liked the way Issacson has   put together this biography. Simple and straight forward narrative style was appealing. Felt like having a close encounter with the multifaceted    personality of Steve and his personal peculiarities. Thoroughly enjoyed the book. Would like  to re-read once in a while. This    has become  a lovable collection to my book shelf. After reading this book,  Issacsons other biographies have been added to my ‚Äúto be read‚Äù list",4
A good read that captures the important and many unknown events of this 'crazy' person the world calls Steve Jobs. The book begins sluggishly and kind of plods on initially describing Jobs earlier days. However the narration picks up when Apple I is introduced and does help one know the important events of his life all through next.,4
From the beginning till the ending the book shows jobs life through different angles.It shows what led to his success and also to his failure to achieve somethings.Issacson presentation is quite good and seems original.People who are interested in gadgets and technology will like the book further.,4
"The biography is beautifully narrated giving details of the ups and DOWNS of the man who set out to change the world of artistic computing.. and more importantly succeeded in doing so.. It gives a detailed account of what translated into making Apple, what it is today and the life of a visionary who created and nurtured the art of perfectionism... ! !Hats off, Mr. Jobs.. We love you and you'll always be missed..",4
"Just finished reading this biography, though it took few days reading the book, it was worth. U will come to know Steve Jobs closely after reading this masterpiece by Walter Isaacson. Author was never judgmental throughout the book. You will come to know what a creative genius task master Steve was, though far from being a good human being...........",4
"The book has described various instances of the Steve's passion for perfection and simplicity ....also the ""reality distortion field""........mood swing........'un-loyaly'......innovative skill....getting the best of the 'A' class people....realizing the potential of product yet to come to existence....... and finally developing unique awesome and historic products ....",4
"A outstanding work by Walter: Simple but effective language. Research is done extensively in field of Steve professional life and his interests in the life, his character and likes dislikes. It left an very deep impression on my mind and with Walter's eyes which are honest I could see the Job life and his passions. I learned from Steve that focus and Quality always will win later or early.",4
"A genius who lived life by his terms. He wasn't the perfect businessman... But relentless hunger to success and perfection always pays.If you still don't believe what this maverick is capable of, watch Toy Story - The perfect Animation movie ever!",4
"First of all thanks Flipkart t for the wonderful services.This book is great source of inspiration. His life, the way he started, the things that made him bold..Reading this book will help you to achieve success even if you had a worse start. So why hesitate. Just Go and order your copy. This is a book that you can give as a gift to your teacher,  brother , sister or friends.Physical properties.Very strong Cover. Clean design just like Apple products.DeliveryNo need to worry.",4
"If I put together a list of books about the various facets of the life of Steve Jobs (notable examples include iWoz about Steve Wozniak, iCon about Apple, The Pixar Story about Pixar, From Pepsi to Apple about John Sculley), this book would still stand out for its comprehensiveness, balanced viewpoint and for being more than the sum of its parts.",4
"Steve Jobs"" by Walter Isaacson is a chronicle of a complex, brash genius who was crazy enough to think he could change the world ‚Äì and did.",4
"The whole meaning of the above advertisement is so clear now after reading the book,job's hysterical appetite for perfection dazzles and inspires you ,the book keeps the interest on and one keeps on flipping pages after pages awed by the genius and craft of Job's. Nobody's perfect ...but then you have to read through the book to know what makes it ""PERFECT""....",4
"I had chosen to read ""Icon Steve Jobs"" by Young and Simon before this book came out because I had thought that considering the kind of person Steve was it would be better to read an unauthorised biography.",4
"This book is worth reading. Although Steve Jobs was one hell of a manager to deal with, who often thrashed others ideas, fired employees at his will, yet you develop a liking to this guy.He is a true ""iCon"", nevertheless others did copy his keynote style to his devices. Author does add relevant info ahead of timeline to keep reader curious. Nice Job(s)!! !",4
I had pre-ordered my copy and Flipkart was amazing with their response to deliver and also answer all my queries with ease and patience.Very good service by flipkart and the book is just amazing. Less said the better.Thanks Flipkart for making it possible! Delivered just in 2 days of international launch.,4
"Based on all anecdotes, interviews and such things this book is good read, reveling Steve Jobs the man. One should go through other books like apple confidential 2.0, Return to little kingdom and iCon also. Many dimensions of Apple Inc., Steve and other persons  are enclosed but this history could have other chapters also. The book is good to pick but not the last one...",4
Very nice book. It's the hard cover edition. All white. Just like Apple. It also has a 16 page photo paper section containing some pictures. All people who love Apple or Steve Jobs must buy this book.Book was delivered very fast within 2 days.,4
didn't read yet.quality good.took a bit of time for delivery.,4
"The book came in awesome packaging and was promptly delivered.Coming to the book review, it's a lengthy book having around 531 pages to read. It shows how Steve Jobs struggled to build the world's most valuable company. It gives out the detailed explanations and  views of different people to whom Jobs was associated. He was a drop out from his University. But that doesn't deter him from doing what he intends to do. It is a book that shows the true colour of Jobs.",4
Full of motivation,4
The quality of book is good!,4
A nice read and gives insight about initial days of Apple. Love the part where Steve replaced Soda with fruit juices.Also got to know that GUI was NOT stolen from Xerox but was a deal between Apple and Xerox as Xerox management did not believe in GUI/mouse concept.,4
"Steve Jobs has left the message for future generations, through his work and achivements, is that there is something beyond money, power and lust. Even with his death, at just 56, Steve conveyed that no matter how much money you have you can not extend your life by a single day! He taught world that your time is limited, don't waste it in living someone else's life, but, what did he done with himself! He used his best 'limited' time for creating better others life.",4
"The quality of book was not that much better, but as per cost 340 i can say it's okay. Thanks flipkart.",4
Best book for your enhancement of life,4

this is really an asset. Anybody who loves reading books should not miss this book. I recommend this as a must read by anyone,4
Book has a good hard binding and is sturdy and sheds light on the evolution of Apple Inc and covers intricate details of Steve Jobs life. It is a lengthy book but you can resume reading even after a weeks gap.. :),4
"This book was delivered very fast to me within a day and also the book seems very good in terms of quality, hard bind and as reading day by day the way book is written is very good. This also seems inspiring about how Apple was was born and till date and all the happenings in it.",4
"If you are a Jobs and Apple Fan, its inevitable that you'll like this book, it has everything that you would have been waiting to read bout this man. Greatly depicted and illustrated the diverse and eventful life of Jobs...",4
"A must read for those who not just want to know about Jobs but also about the making of Apple, the brains behind it, its business strategies, its quarrels with Microsoft and a lot more. A must read for those who not just want to know about Jobs but also about the making of Apple, the brains behind it, its business strategies, its quarrels with Microsoft and a lot more.",4
THIS IS AN INSPIRATIONAL BOOK. EVERYONE SHOULD READ IT AND GO THROUGH EVERY ONE OF THIS BOOK AND MAKE A IT A POINT IN THEIR LIFE. WELL I WOULD DEFINATELY RECOMMED IT ALL BUYERS WHO WANT TO DO BIG IN LIFE ALSO WHO WANT TO BE BIG BUSINESS MAN IN LIFE,4
"Reading Steve Jobs by Water Isaacson - I feel that the writing style of Isaacson is making the biography more impactful. I mean the incidences which happened in his life are so impactful & meaningfully described, correlated & concluded that even Jobs would not have thought about those in his life. I am bit confused don‚Äôt know whether the writing style & narration is making the things great or actually he was? ?",4
"A good biography but little biased towards describing behaviour of the great Apple Icon ! The author definitely shows his frustration between the lines about not getting access to all the information he would have needed. Nonetheless, this is the only comprehendum of all the small anecdotes we read and hear about Steve Jobs.",4
"A bit on the long side, but with insight into what made Steve and Apple (with a side track on Pixar). The biggest take-away from the book for me was the secret of 'impute'- ‚ÄúWe may have the best product, the highest quality, the most useful software, etc. If we present them in a slipshod manner, they will be perceived as slipshod; if we present them in a creative, professional manner, we will impute the desired qualities.‚Äù",4
"Fascinating, in depth look into the life of a man that shaped history and technology as we know it. I thought the different points of view shown by the various interviews was great, especially since it was revealed that Jobs did not have editing power. The book was long but kept my interest.",4
"I pre-ordered this book and got it 2 days after the international release date, I am through with the first half of it, and I am quite impressed at how the author has managed to capture some of Jobs's turning point moments without the general monotone which is attached to biographies generally, a good read for people who want to know what made Jobs tick and what didn't.",4
"A must read I would say. The cover is great - carries the trademark Steve Jobs/Apple impressions - very simple, very minimal, very attractive. Once you are into the book, you enter the mysterious world of Steve Jobs. His journey upto launch of iPod had many mysteries and as a reader we hope to know about them all. However, somehow I kept feeling that the book stops just short of unraveling it all. You keep feeling like compilations of media reports and interviews - like a documentary.",4
"As always, Flipkart has delivered on time. You guys rock and in a country where a lot of things runs behind schedule, this aspect of your service is really fantastic. Coming to the book, i have seen the cover and read the first few pages so far and from the look of things, i am happy that i pre ordered this book.",4
"He was not perfect. He was not philanthropic. He was erratic in his demeanor. He was pricky. He was many a times rude in his opinion. He was bipolar in his judgements. You were either a genius or a bozo.He was all that you would NOT want to be and all that you would really want to be.A book that does not pass a judgement. A book that does not eulogize him. A perfect ""One more thing..."" by the best CEO the world has seen in the recent times.A must read !!",5
"What makes Steve Jobs so good? That's one Big reason why I wanted this Book! (Long before Mr. Job's death). You see I have this small magical thing called ""iPod"" which makes me go bonkers over and over again.... The sexy Android in bag wouldn't have been a reality without iPhone (I don't think Mobile Giants would have even dared to go this BIG with Touch without Apple's giant leap!) and don't even get me started over ""Mac n iPad"".",5
"Extremely happy with the product. I had a little bit of apprehension about the originality of the product but when the product arrived, there was none. The book is as original as any other original book I've ever bought. this actually clears my perception of Flipkart regarding the originality of books and I look forward to buying more on the platform. Plus there were a lot of bookmarks as well with the product which made me double happy. Kudos to Flipkart.",5
"I was looking forward to this book with Harry potter-esque excitement, before I begin this review I think I should mention that I am the kind of person who watches Steve Jobs' keynote addresses repeatedly for FUN! Me and my brother r the kind of people who find his product launches more fun than watching iron man, so I am definitely not as objective as a reviewer should be but still I will do my best.",5
The insanely great person of the earth with his inspired journey. I love the work done by Steve Jobs. He is the best entrepreneur of the globe.,5
"The biography of a man who changed the way the world thought about computers, changed them from industrial devices to an indispensable part of our lives, Walter Isaacson's account of Jobs's life is hallucinatory in parts, and illuminating in others. Having been a Steve Jobs fanboy (but not Apple's, since I'm Indian and cheap), large parts of the biography appear heard about to me.",5
One of the best i have read. The way Walter wrote about Jobs life right from his birth shows a balance.While reading the book its as if the entire story took place right in front of you. Beautifully written without taking a side.Coming to Jobs i can just say that after reading the book it gives me immense pleasure to even say i was there when he was there. The person with the most complicated emotions yet he showed the world what he can do.,5
"Received the book before the expected delivery date. Its an original book, well packed, good condition. its a motivational book and a must read for all who wants to excel in their career or want to grow as an entrepreneur.",5
The best book ever received . Though they didn't give bookmark but this is an inspiration to think to make today better than yesterday and tomorrow the best. Belief is the only thing which makes us successful. Hence its said it's not necessary to win every battle to win a war.,5
"This book doesn't need a review. Its a biography. And it shows how a great visionary and genius like Steve Jobs was only human, with all its failings. Its worth your time if you love the work Steve did, OR even if you are a computer or technology enthusiast or even if you dont support Apple. Just be open minded when you read this!",5
"If you're a fan of Jobs or are just intrigued in finding out what made the man click, this book provides a brilliant insight into his life. Every phase of his life is described in detail and this books gives a real understanding of what a complex man Jobs truly was. You feel as if you're growing with Jobs as you read through the book.",5
"For a rare and inconsistent reader like me, the book was captivating. Not just because of the hype created about Steve's health in the blogosphere and media but also because of the man himself. I for one never really liked Apple for their irrational pricing of their products, especially in India. This book has done to me what Steve had intended to do any curious reader of this book; convert that poor soul to Mac.",5
"The print and paper quality isn't bad, it's actually better than average. About the condition of the book, it's in perfect condition and the packaging was also great. Opinions on the books are subjective, but trust me, if you're a tech nerd or if you love Apple Inc, you'd love it.",5
I have bought this book and found it very impressive. It describes that how You should overcome all your problems and later become a successful person. Steve Jobs is a successful and a good person too. You will find out after reading this book. It also tells that how apple products became popular. This book is very inspirational and you will not found boring in it. It is very interesting. READ IT Great book.,5
"Excellent Biography written by Walter Isaacson, as he does always. Really, very detailed talks on Steve jobs and its life. This book is perfect partner who want to know Steve Jobs thoroughly.Must go for this book. And as usual best service provided by Flipkart on delivery.",5
Gives us the correct view of Jobs and every pat and incident of his life ...... it is not just a biography . If you idolize steve jobs ...then its a must buy...but otherwise it will be a little boring on some parts.... overall i loved this book as i'm a great steve jobs fan,5
"It is a comprehensive account of the life of Steve Jobs, indicating both his strengths and weaknesses, great achievements and setbacks. For me, inspiration to achieve excellence was attained more by reading this book than any other book, many of which are focused on the subject of inspiration! The path of obsession leads to success, obsession for perfection, not money or fame; this point has been illustrated by various life examples of Steve Jobs.",5
"just nothing to say, spellbound...amazing penning by Walter Isaacson.A real genius(iGenius) mr.Jobs. very inspiring book, after read it you can understand how a man stands apart from the common race. Hats off to the desperacy of Steve Jobs.iSalutemust read it,feel it, a vwery much worth read.good illustration and great delivery from flipkart.",5
"Was gifted by my sister through Flipkart.. Awesome read.. If you are successful - read it, if you want to be successful read it...The sheer passion for technology , design and 'Diets' is an interesting read...",5
I took longer than usual to read this book. I sometimes reread certain parts. It was absolutely mesmerizing to know the creative genius behind the world's most elegantly designed electronics. The author has structured the book in such a way that the reader experiences a flow. His cancer days and the way he fought it is truly inspirational. A wonderful read altogether!,5
This book is truly awesome and I suggest anyone who is fond of technology should read it because it not only tells about a true legend but also how the computers got developed from the mid 70s.You will know how our modern world of technology has been created and its a great honor to know about an astonishing personality who changed the future forever.Thank You Steve for everything...Thank You Walter for making Steve much closer to us...,5
"This book gives an insight about Steve Jobs life. The book is simply an awesome read. Its very well written and talks about the bright as well as dark aspects of Steve's life. Sometimes the book becomes repetitive but still worth buying. In Steve's words , the book is insanely great.",5
Wonderful Read!! A great masterpiece.. I have become a great fan of Walter Isaacson.. My dad also liked the book.. Its a great learning as well! !And Thanks to Flipkart for the best service as always! !,5
"The book awes you right from the moment you look at the hard cover emblazoned with the penetrating look of Jobs right to every word  and sentence woven up by Walter Isaacson ,one hell of a book reading experience so far the eloquence and the mix of reality with the literary awesomeness of the writer replete with quotes and sayings right from Shakespeare to Jobs' contemporaries makes it a must buy,barely been through 17% of the book and just can't let it go...Must read for all apple fans:)",5
"I know some C, wanna learn JAVA, need to be very clear about the OOP's part. All those terms and Jargon will be made clear, and wonder what you can explain others :) :)  you will grow in such a way. Worth a buying",5
"Its a classic read.Language is simple and you don't have to be an avid reader to understand the nip-tucks. I will suggest you all to watch this movie ""Pirates of Silicon Valley"". Excellent movie and you can relate more with this biography then. Gives a lucid peep into lives of Steve Jobs,Bill Gates,Steve Ballmer,Steve Wozniack and war between these giants.",5
"Amazing feeling when i have this book in my hands! As everyone said, the book's cover itself is more graceful and appealing. The narration needs to be appreciated, life history of Jobs expressed lucidly. Not everyone we admire but steve jobs is an exception, he is such respectable innovator of the modern era. To know more about him is a roller coaster ride for anyone. So far i completed Chapter 12 [The Design: Real artists simplify]. I'm travelling deep into this book.",5
"Great experience with Flipkart service and also for reading this book. Very interesting book to read. One should get the insight out of Steve's life. His experiences,work,ideas, situations etc are all very interesting to read out.",5
"A Peek into a Genius's Mind! Read slowly and you will understand the depth of his passion for Perfection!What makes Steve Jobs so good? That's one Big reason why I wanted this Book! (Long before Mr. Job's death). You see I have this small magical thing called ""iPod"" which makes me go bonkers over and over again.... The sexy Android in bag wouldn't have been a reality without iPhone (I don't think Mobile Giants would have even dared to go this BIG with Touch without Apple's giant leap!)",5
"Excellent book ! Sensitively written with alternate chapters on his work and personal life. Lots of information as Jobs had given him a lot of access . I met Isaacson at an event around the book, organized by the Aspen institute. He graciously autographed a copy of the book, and spoke about how the ""intuitive"" approach t using a computer was influenced by Steve Jobs time in India, and experience of eastern philosophies",5
Great inspirational book. Describes Steve's life tragedy in every detail. Really value for money product. I also get a free cool bookmark with every book purchase from Flipkart!,5
Firstly the overall packaging is great and really easy to open. And the delivery is very fast and on right time which is a great thing and inside the product is very well safe and in great state.üòÅ,5
"best book of all time , and about the book position is absolutely amazing and good paper quality or best packaging from seller,  thank you flipkart",5
"brilliant!!! an amazing book that explores the mind of a genius in an honest, engaging and fascinating way!",5

After five month after the received date I completed reading this book.It just makes you think about what makes a business great and what is the role of arts in making a product.,5

"Very nice to read. It contains excellent examples of how a product has to be envisioned, lead to completion and most of all how to market it! Learnt a lot",5
"A good read for ambitious people; artist, designer, businessmen...You need to pick up the your thing from a mixed package of things. Steves J. was good and bad at places. Instead of measuring him if you can pick up the right things, then it was worth reading. Writing is very simple, nothing special, nothing creative.",5
"I had a hardcover version of this book shortly but didn't manage to finish it in time. So I went for the inexpensive paperback edition. Great print and paper quality, the photos from Jobs' personal archive in the middle of the book are pretty amazing as well. Just shows how the paperback edition managed to maintain its standards.Haven't finished reading yet, only 100 pages or so in, but the biopic is incredibly well written and very informative.",5
I will not give review about the content of the book cause many other users have already written so much about what's inside the book. The biography of Steve Jobs is very well written no doubt and that's the only thing you need to know. If you know who this man is and if you are a fan of his work BUY this book.One thing I would like to point out is the price of the book and many other items on flipkart keep on changing every week..,5
"People are apple fans or apple haters. I am Steve Jobs fan boy. I have been reading and watching so many things about him in past 3-4 years, that any piece of writing about him inspires me a lot. Coming to this book, its brilliantly written. Author is completely unbiased about everything he approached. Its awesome. Big book though, but totally worth it.",5
"If you are an apple fanboy or not,it is is highly recommended to read this book.An inspirational story of the founder of worlds most valuable company.",5
Must read for anyone who is in IT field. You can feel the genius of Steve Jobs. Great Book. Great Great book.,5

"Book Review :   Steve Jobs  by Walter Issacsson Steve Jobs written by Walter Issacsson is one of the best records of the eventful life of the worldwide phenomenon, none other than Steve Jobs. Walter Isaacson in this skillfully written biography, smartly reveals  that both the true believers and the cynics got Jobs wrong.",5
I have learned many things from this great personality . His clear vision regarding the apple products made me interesting and made my vision towards the goal clear . Coming to the Flipkart service they have done very good job .,5
"This is one of the best biographies I have read till date. Very beautifully written, has lot of insights on Steve Jobs, Apple, the IT industry. Very interesting to read.",5
Very good book not just to know about Steve Jobs but also to know about how he liked to work and the secret of his success.,5

"Hats off to flipkart for delivering it before delivery date....!About the book now, yet again Walter Issacson strikes with masterpiece. Previous books were good but this one is best. No words can express the feelings about the person the book is all about STEVE JOBS, the maestro of marketing. The book build is really good and comparatively cheap in India. I saw book abroad but it was costly.",5
quality of the book is very nice and one thing i would like to say that walter issacson is a brilliant writer.,5
Walter Isaacson did a brilliant job while try to portray the life of the genius Steve Jobs. Unknown stories from his life has been revealed for the first time to the public in a candid manner which portrays his softer side. A brilliant read and a masterpiece in writing. This book is a must have in anyone's collection.,5
"A very nicely written biography which not only tells a great story about one of the greatest innovator but also helps readers in understanding a lot about life , approch towards it and results.A MUST READ for anyone",5
"Recommended book for self believe , innovation and out of box thinking.I am not the same person after reading this book , this story of this great man is given in the most appropriate way and without supressing facts.I would definitely recommend this book for everyone...",5

Its a MUST read for all the Steve Jobs Fans and I would go one step ahead and encourage all the Entrepreneurs and startup enthusiasts to read this precious biography.,5
"However, just wondering if a book is written about a certain way of being cool, does that way of being cool remains cool enough, after it is practically shoved down the throats of people who want to be cool, in a cool way.",5
"This man changed the way our mobiles work today..our music players are..he reimaged everything he set to start. With a extraordinary drive and passion for perfectionism, Jobs a college dropout, setout to establish the world's most valuable company. He showed me what enthusiasm,passion,drive is all about.with his extraordinary taste for detail he is likely to inspire the next few generations of entrepreneurs and hippies;P",5
"I am a huge Steve fan and I read this book right after it was launched. I bought the ebook, but I found it so mesmerising that I bought the hardcover as well. The book is very well focused on Steve and it paints the picture of the man whose life was quite extraordinary. I have read about 4-5 biographies on Jobs and can safely say this was the best. The book was ordained by Steve himself and has his own insights included as well which the others lack.",5
"I brought this this after watching the movie ""jobs"". I was eager to know about the personal life of steve jobs .And this book is a must read of engineering graduates as it surrounds up with companies like ibm, intel  ,hp.How those companies were started during the young days of jobs, what led him to start a company like apple and of course the competitions he faced in his life (both in business and personal life).really worth reading.",5
First of All thanks to FLIPKART for the super Fast delivery/..The book is well written and truly inspiring.Its a totally diffrent view of Job's life.Its simply SUPERB!,5
I have used this product and bought it from flipkart. Delivery was good. The book all around is amazing. Its nothing but good words put together in 500 pages. This is a must have on your bookshelf. Many people nowadays prefer to read Percy Jackson and all those things I don't know why. When I go to my friend and tell I've read this book and they go like are u an idiot why do u read biographies.,5
Flipkart delivery was awesome with timely delivery and very well packed. Also I refer everyone to go ahead with this book who ever looks for quality of the book.,5
One can motivate through Steven's life at greatest extent ! Simply amazing to read and impliment ! His skills innovations seriously encourage one to take him at highest peak of glory .,5
"Only after reading the book could I understand what a genius Steve Jobs was. The book has changed my whole approach towards delivery, quality, precision. Thank you Walter Isaacson for the narrative. I have already gifted this to so many friends of mine. Must read! !",5
"Steve Jobs - A man who has a vision to make the best products of world (best in the sense - best in every thing in terms of physical look, specifications, simplicity, elegant software......In my view This guy changed the world with his revolutionary vision in Electronics .",5
awesome book .. great quality .. great paper quality ...the content is also nice i'd recommend any apple or steve jobs admirer or anyone to read it ...its just awesome - i am an apple products fan and a steve's fan -,5
the whole story was honestly told. Sometimes i thought Steve Jobs was a jerk only and sometimes i found the book boring but i could never abandon reading this book. It tells you how people with talents and skills make their ways through the dark. Steve is my idol now. It'll not only tell you the story of Steve but also inspire you to do great and new. The story is really is so movie like. Walter Isaacson did full justice to the great innovator,5
A great book about a great person who revolutionized the music and mobile phone industry. The author was precise in his writting giving away every details about the ups and downs of Jobs. If your not even a fan of Steve you would love this book.,5
"Steve Jobs is one of the most inspiring business leaders of our time. His innovations forever impacted industries of personal computing, mobile phones, animation films, music and tablet computing. He had penchant for creating brilliant products/tools for people who wanted to change the world. By being an architect for much of the above life-changing innovations he made a ‚Äòdent in the universe‚Äô as he always wanted to.The above is what we all know.",5
"This biography is presented in very simple, truthful and humble way, portraying Steve Jobs's personality, life and career. This book instills inspiration in anyone who can connect to Jobs. Must read...",5
"By far  one of the best written biopics ever.Walter Isaacson has written a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing.",5
One of the first times i have read an entire book of this size within such a short time. Its a must know story for anyone who likes to read about inspiring leaders. The author has really done a good job in collating all the information about a wonderful personality. Bringing out both sides of the face makes the book even better.,5
"This is a story of a man who never had any direction in his life. Awfully arrogant, he first saw & recognized the genius of Wozniak. Starting his journey in his dad's garage, Jobs went on to build a company that not only executed fantastic and seminal ideas, but seamlessly integrated engineering and design to create magical products. Under his domineering leadership, Apple was able to invent superbly great consumer products, re-defining the entire user experience.",5
"This book is written by walter Isaacson ... what else you want??? Beautifully written.. Best book till date .. I.e, there are lot of books on and about steve but this one is da best .... Go for it !!Pros... You start loving the book as soon as you start reading the prologue of it..What I see like a reader is, a book should be well documented and should be articulate.. nothing should be unsubstantiated. This is perfectly that onecons -I hate the cover pic ;)",5
Pure and fantastic views on steve jobs.- Jobs idea of simplicity and sofastication.- Jobs ideas on putting up a show or launch.- Best is on last pages where he thinks 'if company left to sales people will loose its charm'.Good & bad all about Jobs - leaves you not will all answers but a fun reading.Reminds me of the character in the book 'The Fountain Head'. Art is the best I can think and there is no other form of pirated art or compromised art.,5
"As always, Flipkart delivered it on the second day I ordered the book. This is an amazing book. Kudos to the author Issacson, made  very good points about Steve without showing any kind of bias. One gets to know about Steve, Apple and everything around him in a true form. At the end of the book, you would get an answer for the question why every genius has a trait of madness with in him.",5

Steve Jobs was no doubt a great person in the history of tech world. This book makes me feel like Steve Jobs is my friend and while reading he is giving me lots of ideas to develop a great products for the world.,5
Very in-depth biography of a genius mind from Isaacson. Steve was a simple man but he revolutionized modern tech with astonishing devices. He brought Apple out of certain bankruptcy and made it the most valuable company in the world. Book covers his both personal life and business strategies. Very inspirational.,5
"A comprehensive account about the life of a legend.. a man who redefined computer, animation movie, music, mobile and tablet PC industries with his cutting edge products and built two of the most valuable brands of our time (Apple and Pixar) .. 'part genius, part artist, part visionary , part sadist, part fanatic' but nonetheless an extremely fascinating person.. one of the greats of the 21st(and 22nd :P) century..",5

"One of the best books ever, Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson brings Steve Jobs back to life.This book is more than just a biography. It's like having Mr. Jobs sitting next to you and narrating his life story to you. It's one of the most vividly written book of all time, indeed.It is almost a 700 pages book and gives you everything you needed. It is worth buying if you want to UTILIZE your money.

"""THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CRAZY ENOUGH TOTHINK THEY CAN CHANGE THE WORLD ARE THEONES WHO DO""A story of passionist, demon, perfectionist,artistand a man of conscience. This Biography is an apttribute to Steve Jobs. It covers the life of Jobsthrough his various Up's and Down's. A book MUSTREAD for all those who want a glimpse in the mindof Jobs.",5

"The best biography for Steve Jobs in the market right now and the one officially acknowledged by him and his family.Not that interesting however if you are not interested in knowing about the legend that was Steve Jobs.Does this mean anything to you: 	Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat.",5
"This is a really really good biography of the most incredible man of recent times. Really touching parts throughout his story. At time, you pause and think, excellent piece of writing. Must read for all future entrepreneurs , geeks, Apple fans , and the layman too.",5
"I own Apple devices so I read this book. The man behind super innovation which lead to change in the way I listen to music, touch to call someone etc etc.In case some one who donot own an Apple device, it is a must to read the book and know the man behind the devices. Then you would know why people are mad about an Apple.Overall an awesome book, crisp to the point.",5
"When I heard of this book, I thought to myself, what more of Steve Job's life is unheard of. I have seen countless interviews and even a movie on him. But when I finally got to read it, I was just awestruck. In Steve's own language, the book is insanely great and boom! it made a dent in my universe.",5
This is one big hardbound book and recommended for all Steve Jobs' fans. I'm looking forward to read it. Contains nothing but the truth(bad and good) about Jobs.Also awesome packaging by flipkart so as to protect it from damages.,5
"Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson is my most prized possession. Before reading this book, I had read a lot of articles on Steve Jobs and every article reflected some charachter of him. This book deeply discovers how, when and why of Steve Job's life. Entire portion of the book except the last few chapters (They are pretty rushed up. These chapters include the events from the year 2010-2011) are in very much detail and one can clearly picture what sort of person he was in real.",5
"it is not only a biography it is a story behind apple. today the apple brand name is synonymous with Steve.the book is a well narrative of Steve's life and work. the book holds your interest till last page is turned. in this book you will find both his personal life and professional life equally narrated. again, the book is written by such a personality who is highly acclaimed in this class.",5
"What made Steve Jobs different? What makes Apple different? This book gives us an idea of the inherent difference between Apple and all the other companies in the world. It was driven by the vision of one man, built it in such a way, that it would function as well without him. The book also is a fair insight into his traits and aspects of his behaviour (mostly unpleasant, in the earlier days). What drove him was his passion, and self taught dogmatic beliefs.",5
Still in page 123 of the book and must say I am extremely impressed. Each page is a gem and each chapter has anecdotes that have a great story-telling value. I am kind of reading it slowly because I don't want the book to get over. Walter Isaacson is very non-judgemental and has given a very objective view of Jobs. The book gives us a peek not only into Jobs' psyche but into the times he was living and lives of many other amazing personalities. It is a must read.,5
"One of the best book. It inspires very man to achieve that feels impossible for you. This book is the best example for dedication, determination and Devotion and describes that every ordinary man will have an hidden extraordinary talent himself but he has to explore on his own with a planned execution. Worth the money for spending on this book",5
"simply awesome ! its Steve centered and excellent in reading .must buy,smart brief writing ! just read it calmly and you will get to know about his life.it's a rich portrait of one of the greatest minds of our generation.",5
"Steve Jobs has binary vision. Rubbish or Genius. This book belongs to the latter category. This is a must buy for those who have even a little bit of interest in computers or design! That being said, Steve Jobs is pure Genius and Walter Isaacson make this fact known without bias. He brings out Jobs' Bipolar nature throughout the book and in the end you feel like you knew Steve Jobs, the person, not the iCon.",5
"An excellent read. We all are human being,hence we are not perfect! He has flaws. But he vercome it. He became a trend changer. A fine man. More I read more I feel awesome about the person.and the FLIPKART service is awesome. Even I bought this book in Christmas , they send it to me within 48 hours! Good Job!",5

"Think Different as its stated below apple product...Steve Jobs is also different CEO of company . Man works against all odd and use his own strategy to get success...At a time when societies around world are trying to build digital-age economies, Jobs stands as the ultimate icon of inventiveness and applied imagination.",5
Steve Jobs was a great man! He changed computing forever. This indeed is a great book about Steve Jobs and it has been written by Walter Isaacson.The book is nicely bound and the paper quality is great. The book is a pleasure to read and entrepreneurs surely shall get inspired by this book!It is a must read!,5
You need not be a person who is entangled in the mediocrity of the b-school admission rush or an alumni of a b school to succeed in life. What matters is the passion for your work. What an amazing read. Be a rebel..... It doesnt matter as long as you think you are doing it right. You will definitely succeed. Definitely a great tribute to a great genius.,5
"Ordered this book through flipkart and as always, I was amazed by their packing and delivery time...too good...What can I say about this book which has been written by a genius about a genius...I took the book in my hands and I thought to myself ""God knows how many months will it take me to read this heavy 650 (roughly) page book"" but boy, once you place it in your hands, you just cant help but flip a page after another.",5
"ITS A SUPERB BOOK.A MUST READ.THE BOOK'S CRISP AND UP TO THE POINT AND NOT EVEN A SINGLE BIT OF DRAGGING.WELL IT WAS A JOURNEY THROUGH STEVE JOBS LIFE WRITTEN SUPERBLY BY WALTER ISAACSON.WE GET TO KNOW A LOT ON JOBS'S CHARACTER ,HIS THRIVING FOR PERFECTION AND KIND OF STUFF.YOU EVEN GET TO KNOW HOW THE WORLD FAMOUS APPLE PRODUCTS CAME TO BE AND LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST HOW IT ALL STARTED",5

"It is not just a book. it is much more than that. it is extremely valuable and i must say Walter Isaacson has acomplished a great task portraying the life of a person who believed and demonstrated...""if you are not busy being born, you are busy dying"". it gives deep insight into the life of an individual who gave precious gifts to mankind and made a dent in the universe and whose life was an epitome of perfect blend of creativity and technology. ilove it.",5
This book turned out to be so well written and well documented that the entire trace of Steve Jobs life can be seen.I am in just awe inspiring love with this book.Just a suggestion: Do one thing is underline those facts and methods that Steve Jobs uses of believes which are also present in you. You will get a clear vision about it.,5
"Steve is an absolute control freak..!! He is always right! Its tough when you come across such guys in real life but its just beautiful when you read about him.. A man with unlimited conflicts... !A Textbook Narcissist, self destructive and a phoenix!Book was well written with attention to detail in every aspect.Flipkart is just awesome and i love it!",5
"HiDont you have the Habit of reading books?? ?......Purchase this book you will never leave reading :-).

SImple, interesting and keeps you hooked on to the book till you finish it.Dont miss it guys. Grab one today.",5
"I am not a not an apple fanatic or an admirer of Jobs. I read this book to know more about him. Isaacson has penned this biography very well. The book describes the growth of silicon valley and the IT giants.The book is very balanced and gives an unbiased sketch of jobs.Informative and well written, includes some really rare photographs.This book is a good read. Those who don't like biographies should try this one.",5
"As Everyone does, I should also start with saying something about the flipkart delivery, they are awesome I got this game delivered real quick.An Amazingly written Book, once you start reading, you just want to go on & on & on. From cover to the content written in it everything is just so AWESOME (as Apple). People who are fond of reading should definitely buy this Book for their Study.",5
"Most inspiring book i have ever read. Indeed he was greatest CEO of all times.Everybody can learn something from this book,it clearly shows how  innovation works.Very Incisively written,A must have for all entrepreneurs.",5
A good  account of a genius  with his  plus and minus points.Gives good insight of  what he did and his aim was.It put  in proper perspective his relation with Bill Gates which is often  misrepresented or misunderstood.Worth reading.,5
Why do i recommend to read this book?1. A great delivery service by flipkart.2. A great packaging by flipkart.3. Simple language used by Mr. Walter.4. A great collection of hand picked photographs of Mr. Jobs. Really a collection to cherish.5. I literally watched each and every video of significant event after completion of the chapter.6. Straight forward thoughts about Mr. Jobs nature.7. Must have in your books collection.,5
"Its like a rational journalist's version of a story - unbiased and undeterred by flaunting gestures to the man who created a cult revolution in the music and computing industry. In a way, the book has been written in a way to make one wonder if Walter Isaacson had ink and a knife in his desk while writing the book.",5
"Steve Jobs was an important tech leader in the current age. Walter Isaacson writes a balanced biography using unprecedented access to Jobs. What a combination! I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about Steve Jobs, Pixar, Apple and get a glimpse of why the company makes great products.I admire Jobs for his achievements, but not for his character.",5
"Amazing book,describes the life of one of the greatest men of the century with great detail. The best part about this book is that gives a true and honest impression of Steve Job's life. MUST READ for everyone.",5
This book is amazingly written by Walter Isaacson. You will receive a great knowledge on Steve‚Äôs work passion‚Ä¶pushing the people to their extremes to get out the best of them. Though he was sometimes evil to some people‚Ä¶.which comes from his passion to make the product simple and complete with a great tied up between best of art and technology. He was crazy about his work and brutally honest and ruthless to people.,5
"This book must be read by everyone. Jobs was not at all interested in Philanthropy, but he made contribution to 6 different industry which no other philanthropist could do. When he asked pastor do god know about people dying in Africa and when he got an answer yes God knows everything from pastor Jobs reply was then I don't have anything to ask/prayer to such a God. This was an amazing thought. I liked it when he gave bottle of icewater to Bill Gates at an interview.",5
"The book does not need any review or rating.Its simply perfect.Those who love Apple and Steve, its an epic.Those who dont.........will never understand it.Along with this book I would recommend to read ""ICON STEVE JOBS : The Greatest Second Act In The History Of Business"" also.It will take you to some more and interesting and unbiased chapters of Steve's life as its an unauthorised biography for which Steve tried to sue the publishers to ban it.Enjoy people..........happy reading.",5
"One of the best biographies that I have read. Steve is no God, he falters, is nasty at times but is inquisitive, is creative and has a brilliant knack for perfection. At many places you can see incidents in Steve's life that mirror those in our own lives. The books is a journey. Its money well invested. Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish",5
"This is one biography you shouldn't miss. This book gives a good picture about how Steve Jobs viewed life. After I started reading this book I learned that he's one person who tried many things in life, his experiences with successes and failures, how failures affected him, what kept him going in tough times. It is a touching story in a different sort of way. A good read.",5
"I am a fan of Steve Jobs. So, when the news about his book came, I was happy. Even if I had to pay Rs. 799 for this book, I would have bought it. I finished reading the book and I am glad I did. I knew that to make things simple is not an easy job, but what actually goes through in making things really simple is what the book will tell you. Read it slowly and read it chapter wise to get the feel of what he his, please don't jump to later chapters without finishing the earlier ones.",5
What this book does is to dissect Steve Job's journey in an episodical fashion. The story is not alien to any but the treatment of the author is definitely better than usual biographies. Don't be discuraged by the size of the book - once you set in - it tranfers you to a different world and it has a pacy lyrical quality ...,5
Could not put it down since the day it got delivered. The magic begins right from the cover photo itself. Classy black and white mugshot of the man himself. Isaacson has done a great job of going into technical detail yet keeping the content interesting. For all non-techies also this is a book you must own.,5
"THE ULTIMATE BOOK, EVEN STEVE WOULD LOVE TO READ THIS....IT CONSISTS OF SOME INVALUABLE PHOTOS RELATING TO STEVE, WHICH YOU WON'T FIND ANYWHERE ELSE.A MUST READ BOOK FOR THOSE WHO LOVED STEVE, LOVED APPLE PRODUCTS AND LOVE THE WAY STEVE WORKED N LIVED HIS LIFE.",5

Just like all apple product come with wonderful design, this book too maintain its legacy of design.A must read for all who want to maintain their iDream.",5
It's awesome experience with flipkart. After reading this book it reminds me how passionate Steve was. He's my ideological father from beginning since i bought iPhone 4 & get my hands on it. It experienced like a phone came from haven. Its amazing to read How perfectionist Steve was. Steve's biography truly inspired me as an MBA student how to get most out of your business.,5
"A great book by Walter Isaacson on the life of Steve Jobs. Its an unflinching tale of the life of Steve Jobs, who dreamed of changing the world. And he did. Its an unbiased biography offering great insights and gets you more acquainted with the mannerisms and conduct of Steve Jobs. You just have to read this book.",5
"I could connect with the book in a way that has not happened in a very long time. He was a class act. He took great care in making his products, products which billions use everyday, products which affect lives and lifestyle. Almost like he was taking care of us in an indirect way. By the way that's good enough philanthropy. The book is insightful, heart-warming and thrilling to say the least. You want to rush to end, but then don't want it to end when it does actually end.",5
Walter Issacson did a good job of keeping all the slides of Steve Jobs in an orderly way resulting in a good readable form.All the events take us to the first days of personal computing Age. Every must read and know how the development of Computing came from Mac -> Windows & iPod-> iPhone-> iPad.very Interesting to Read.,5
best book & its a must read book.all youngsters are advised to read this book and know success in life doesnt come only from education or degree...so dont equate success in life to educational success.this book not only gives insight to jobs life but a good way of leadership.must possess this book frens,5
"The reason Steve was able get people so excited about all things Apple, was because he himself felt that way. I bought my first macbook pro when I started working on my research thesis at the University of Auckland, and before that I had owned a iPOD classic! Each of the gadgets was so much more than a piece of equipment to me; they were and still are my most valued possessions.",5
"so happy that i got this book!even though my purchase was triggered by me being a Jobs Apple fan but the distinct narration style of the author brings alive the late 70s and early 80s.the happenings come to life as you read them.maybe had i read a book like like this some 10 yrs back i just might have headed the entrepreneurial road.awesome reading.STAY HUNGRY,STAY FOOLISH....R I P STEVEN PAUL JOBS",5
"One of the finest books I've ever read. The author takes you through much detailed account of Steve's life; His spiritual quest, his stubbornness, his failures and his second coming! Truly,the journey is the reward!After reading this, you will understand that Steve was not perfect. But it will give you an important insight; There is perfection in imperfection! And that's what zen Buddhism is all about.5/5 stars. A must read!",5
"Here is a biography that is different, bringing the traits of a creative genius like Steve Jobs. One can feel the speciality and traits of Steve Jobs one read through, chapter after chapter. I would consider this book as a 'must read' for people who love that creative zeal. With big fonts and hard binding, it adds ease of reading and handling for the elders.Walter Isaccson has done it again. This book definitely is a tribute to Steve Jobs and a feast to the readers.",5
"The book starts from the authors note saying how he began writing the book. It goes with stevejobs birth,his parents and how he developed interest on electronics.Gives all the information on inside apple issues and the background behind developing the most innovative products. Photographs are pretty good,wish they had included more. Readers who dont know anything about apple may find difficulty in relating events.",5
first of all thumbs up for flipkart's timely service. the book arrived before time and its very cheap as compared to its printed price.,5
"Walter Isaacson has captured the way Jobs life was. The sections I loved most are his views right from IBM to Microsoft to Bill Gates  to people who worked with him. His way of classifying anything or anyone into best or crap, insanely great or shit head.If you like Jobs, it will be an adventure, a journey with him. you will learn about his views, the artistic skills, getting things done, changing and revolutionizing the industry.A big book worth reading every page.",5
"After reading a good review for this book. Today I also brought the same for myself. Nice printing, good font, highly visible. looking forward to read.",5
"The book by Walter Isaacson is a Study of Universe within a Beast of Perfection Passionate about Perfection. A true Perfectionist and a Dexterous Inventor, a Universe with Infinity of Ideas and Energy. Along with an Endless Fight with World, Loved Ones, even Himself. 'A Master Of All'. A Pied Piper taking the Consumers (Mouse) to the 'I' World (Cheese). Truly Father of Business with Vision of Machiavelli.",5
"A balanced portrait of a complicated and compelling man.REMOVING the sleeve reveals a book that is entirely white, except for the names of its author and subject in elegant black type on the spine. It is the perfect design for the biography of a man who insisted that even the innards of his products be exquisitely crafted, and that his factory walls gleam in the whitest white.Mr Isaacson offers new perspectives.",5
"Excellent book for Steve Jobs' desciples! I see him as one of my role models and I would say this book is brilliantly narrated and showcases both the beautiful and ugly side of him. If you are fond of reading biographis I would suggest you to pick it on your wishlist and start reading!I preordered the book on Flipkart a day before it was released and on the day of release I had a book at my doorstep. Flipkart, you guys rock! Keep it up.",5
"The book portrays about his childhood till iResign clearly with no hidden truths as steve wanted it to be.Besides all his ruthless behavior, shuns, perfectionism, advanced technology,user friendly devices, rude response,humor,distortion field the reason for his success is ""make a product which even one of our employees love to buy and use with pride"".which is rarely seen in other Orgs.",5
Steve jobs enjoys the privilege of being one of the greatest person who walked on this planet earth and walter isaacson is the perfect official biographer for him being the same of Einstein and Benjamin Franklin. Author no-where tries to become evangelist or promoter of steve jobs/apple (such trend is often seen in recent biographical books of many tycoons).,5
"The book was as brilliant as I expected. It is written in very intimate and revealing style. If you want to anything about Steve Jobs then there can be no better book than this. Go for it. Although it is a big book (600 pages), you never feel bored. It tells the story of Steve Jobs from his child-hood to his last days. Once I started to read this book I was just hooked to it. I am a slow reader and took one week to complete it. You will be able to find real Steve Jobs after reading this book.",5
"First of all,Thanks to Flipkart for the prompt Delivery.I was Impressed with the First Line in the Book ""The People Who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do"". And that says it all about the Great man.All credits to Walter Isaacson for his efforts to Publish this book.",5
"One of the best Biography I have read in recent times...Stay Hungry,Stay Foolish.I think it was Johny I've who described Steve best, according to him Steve was so direct, abrasive and rude because he was the most sensitive. I know it's a paradox in itself but during the course of the book u realize how true it is.",5
Thank you flipkart for the timely delivery. i was amazed at the quality of service and delivery of your service. I have ordered the book for my friend as a birthday gift and it delivered in an excellent way. Packing was perfect and no damages. My friend was floored by the classy and elegant look of the book. It is a must read for everyone.. Kudos to flipkart ! !,5
This book is for everyone who believes in himself and follows his heart.Walter Isaacson has done an excellent job in depicting the way Steve was living through out his life. You can feel the way Steve lived all through his life. Very intense person and did not compromise his values at any cost.Steve was always energetic and was pushing his team to excel. Steve was always living in the FUTURE he had Created for himself.,5

Guyz the book is Excellent !! A master piece from Isaacson.... The book is well written and well researched. we got to know some Life Fact's of Jobs... And it was a great service from Flipkart......!!! !,5
"I was disappointed with this book. Many of us were expecting this book to reveal the style and working of the great man, his philosophy his inner thoughts. It instead claims that Steve was a products of many things. This books felt like a disappointment to me. It certainly is well written; greatly researched and perhaps presents numerous new facts of Steve's life. But it fails to capture Steve's soul!!",5
This book gives a clear account of the ups and downs in Steve Jobs' life...And you can almost visualize how the apple products came into existence. Never really felt boring at any point of time...,5
Awesome book.Must read.,5
"this book has kept me captivated till the end. If you want to dig deeper into life of one of the most iconic entrepreneur of our time...this is a must read.Two things i have learned form this book, the importance of focus, and importance of meditation .",5

"I am delighted to read this book. A true eye openeer and a MUST read. Highly recommended for anyone who needs direction in life. And also for us, who dont believe in ""Only education can make you intelligent""",5
The book is excellent and great. But I am very disappointed with the book quality. The printing quality is very bad and the font size is also very small. I am very  sad because of this,5
Superb book and its language is nice . I love this book üòòüòòüòò,5

Best biography i have read....,5
"This is a life changing book.It teaches us if we want to be something,no one can stop you.Just think unique and work passionately .Thanks Steve",5
Truly inspiring book....!,5
A good book to read,5
One of the best biographies.,5
Even if the book was not plastic sealed....still I got it in the best condition possible!,5
Awesome book! Read it,5
Very nice,5
Must read,5
Inspiring story. Must read for people who wants to start something of their own.,5
Amazing and so inspiring... I am his fan now..... He was such an amazing guy...! You learn a lot,5
Very good book...,5
"Such a profound biography, it's just amazing. ?‚ò∫",5
happy that i bought this and book is outstanding. flipkart as usual perfect,5
i am a person who is lazy to read books but i started this one  i realized books are another medium of motivation...so im recommending this one..awesome work done by writer,5
"its just awsm, we are no one to say any thing about this book. its not only about steve jobs its about the god of tech world.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !",5
"I love Steve Jobs. As a man he was everything. He made the worst mistakes and the best desicions a person can make all in 1 lifetime. This book has highlighted him as human , as a person amongst us.i Have never read a more inspiring story of a man ever.",5
"steve jobs facing lot of problems and also succeed in life. Every Person in the world steven is one of the example. Every day and every second we are always ready for facing problems ""This is the Life"".",5
The book doesn't need a review as it is a biography if u like steve jobs and want to know more about his life then buy it. I am reading this book and it is amazing. Steve Job is a genius. This book is really long but still is very interesting. BUY IT IF YOU CAN !!!!!!!! !,5
"A great leader who doesnt compromise on what he needs, ""Customers doesnt know what they need"" and ""great artists doesnt copy they steal"". Author writing is so unique that he doesnt pass his judgment and keeps you thrilled through out the book. Dont think that you cant read it becuase of the volume of the volume of the book.",5
"I was waiting for this book from a long time.A story of a legend.He is an iconic leader with a watermark of success, Steve Jobs has done it all, someone everyone should look up to and can be proud of, he will be missed always.Regards",5
As far as Book is considered people are giving 5 star rating because it is a book on Steve Jobs.. but as i have read icon too parts of Steve`s life is repetitive but the book differs due people interviewed and their opinion about steve jobs.. which makes the book better than icon,5
"Really, Loved this book. Steve Jobs really did change the world. He lived a miserable life. Please read more about him. If you are a student, then the book Who Was Steve Jobs? Book is very nice. It's very brief and short but tells us everything about him. It's published by Grosset And Dunlap, a part of Puffin Books. (Quick Fact: Did you know Steve Jobs when returned to Apple, paid himself only $1 dollar per year!). Recommend this book to all.",5
Just amazing....!! !,5
"Like the name of the book, the book is itself straightforward, blunt and simple in approach. But dont even think for a moment that Steve Jobs' life was a simple, plain and boring one. He is one of the most complicated personalities to walk on this planet. Storytelling is great and a great job by Walter Isaacson in portraying the most confusing yet extraordinary person in a easy way. (Quick Question: Did you know Steve Jobs owned PIXAR(animation company) and later sold it to Disney?",5
A very good book to read for those who want to achieve something in life...,5
dis z d most influential book i hav ever read .guys must read dis book .its shows me d path & open's d door of immense knowledge.Wht 2 say abt Walter Isaacson....dude u r jst marvelous. thanks flip kart....,5
Awesome delivery and supply chain co-ordination.. I called up your customer care last evening requesting for a possible urgent delivery as I was going out of station. I was not expecting any urgent delivery after having had unpleasant experiences with ebay. But I was pleasantly surprised that the delivery was well before time.. Flipkart you rule !!!!,5
"Got it today morning , have read a couple of pages .Though Jobs didn't opt to pre read the book , but he sure rejected  the cover initially chosen .. The one he has chosen is NEAT and a look that tells a lot about the man , as you would read the book deciphering him .Isaacson's narrative style is quite likable , guess would read his Einstein , Roosevelt ones too post completion of this one.",5
It was amazing. People has to read this.,5
Good book page quality good,5
"Best book ever ,",5

"You might have heard about Steve Jobs and know that he has done something for computers. But after reading this book, you will know that he has entirely changed the way humans live. As much as this is a story of Jobs it's also a story of the rising and fall and the rise of Apple. Must read for business people who want to know why Apple is the way it is today.Steve, wherever you are, your products are insanely great and I aspire to be like you someday.
